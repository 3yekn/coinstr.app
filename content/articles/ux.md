Coinstr has two user types: 
1. power users that configure spending policies 
2. spending proposal approvers

# üë∑ Power User
The power user is perhaps an accountant, financial controller, or someone in a company's IT department. This user does not need to be able to write code or understand cryptography, but they do need to be able to use the [blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) powered UI to configure policies.

  usecase "Sweep UTXOs (Coin Control)" as UC2
  usecase "Create Proposals" as UC3
}
pw --> UC1

# ü§µ Approval User
The approval user is someone who will review spending proposals and make decisions about whether or not to sign and approve them.

  usecase "Approve Proposals" as UC7
}

# üîê Authentication

Power users may authenticate to the web application using any compatible Nostr method, including a browser plugin, but the preferred method is to use [NIP-46 Nostr Connect](https://github.com/nostr-connect/nips/blob/nostr-connect/46.md). This method keeps the users' private key(s) safely on their mobile device instead of in the browser.

This video shows [Nostrum](https://github.com/nostr-connect/nostrum), a pioneering NIP-46 compatible mobile app. Coinstr will launch a mobile application (named **Hancock Signer**) that supports NIP-46-style QR-code based signing for Nostr and Bitcoin transactions.

Of course, IRL, instead of using copy and paste from the browser to the mobile app, the QR code will be scanned. 

When an in-browser action requires a signature from the user, a push notification is sent to the mobile app where the user can review and approve.
